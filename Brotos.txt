1) Choose one of the mirrors from the following link and download Centos 7 ISO.
http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1511.iso
2) Open VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine with centos running on it. If you are not sure how to do that, you can check my tutorial on creating virtual machines on VirtulBox.
3) Once you reboot your virtual machine after installation, type "yum update" and then "yum upgrade".
