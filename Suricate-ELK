1) Go to System/Package Manager/Available PAckages
2) Find suricata and install
3) Go to Services/Suricata/Interfaces
4) Add an interface
5) Choose log options (1.png)
6) Go to Global Settings and add rules (2.png)
7) Go to Updates to get the rules (3.png)
8) Do not forget to enbale surricata on the interface. (5.png)
9) You can go to Logs View and see the log files there (4.png)
10) At this point, you should see the logs. If you do not see, reboot pfsense and view log files. 
11) Now ssh to pfsense. You should see the eve.json as in this figure (6.png)
12) Now go to https://beats-nightlies.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=jenkins/filebeat/ and find most recent filebeat-freebsd-386 or filebeat-freebsd-amd64 depending on whether the system is 32-bit or 64-bit.
13) Copy the url of that file.
14) Execute the commands: 
cd ~
fetch https://beats-nightlies.s3.amazonaws.com/jenkins/filebeat/426-79bd08a8db4487c0ddf72486cb1553ded7528df8/filebeat-freebsd-386
mkdir /etc/filebeat
mv filebeat-freebsd-386 /etc/filebeat/filebeat
chmod +x /etc/filebeat/filebeat
15) You also need to create filebeat.yml configuration file. It should be like (7.png). Do not forget to change hosts ip address and port number (logstash server's).
16) Check if the configuration is ok (8.png).
17) Also we need to ensure filebeat is executed on startup. So go to System/Package Manager/Available Packages on pfsense. Install shellcmd.
18) Go to Services/shellcmd. Add command /etc/filebeat/filebeat (9.png). Now it will be executed on startup.
19) We are now done on the pfsense side. Now we will move on to ELK side (logstash server).
20) Now ssh to logstash server and go to /etc/logstash/conf.d. The configuration files needed are (10.png). Here 03-beatinM.conf and 13-suricataM.conf are for eve.json log file. And others are for syslog files. The contents of each conf file is:
01-inputs.conf --> 11.png
02-inputs.conf --> 12.png
03-beatinM.conf --> 13.png
10-pfsense-syslog.conf --> 14.png
11-pfsense.conf --> 15.png
13-suricataM.conf --> 16.png
30-outputs.conf --> 17.png
21) Also you need a pattern file on a separate patterns folder. Its content is (18.png).
22) After these you should run service logstash configtest to check if configuration is ok. (19.png).
23) Type service logstash restart.
24) Now you should see logs in /var/log/logstash/logstash.stdout.
25) You can also see the logs on Kibana GUI (20.png).
